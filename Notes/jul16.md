# July 16th Class Notes

## Midterm talk
- Book is where all the answers are from


## Discussion

### Pitfalls
#### Large Classes

#### Conditional Complexity
- If statements add a huge cognitive load
#### Oddball Solution
- Multiple solutions to similar problems


### Threads / co-routines
- create scope
    - run blocking

- you leave co-routine when starting jetpack so you have to call the scope back in

- Asynchronous
    - code runs "out of order"
    - runs "at the same time"

### Web Framework - KTOR

- ktor is kotlin web framework type thingy
- fairly easy to work with
- don't have to use this for web page, but it will work for what we do in the class
